# Aireem project

## Database

This project was made for the high school thesis (Final Examination, year 2017).

I passed a period of brainstorming in which I analyzed the historical and social context which we are currently 
into, so to realize something which could have been useful to a market domain in which the increasing demand wasn't 
adequately satisfied yet.

The web application which was created enables registered users to offer occasional work performances by making their 
skills available to others, and other people to request services that they need by contacting suitable professionals.

The creating process followed this work-flow:
1. First of all, I have dealt with **Project Management** matters: specifically speaking, it was about _Envisioning_ 
and _Branding_, so I've laid the foundations of the new-born startup by defining
  * Mission
  * Vision
  * Values
and then choosing the name (***Aireem***) and creating the logo.
2. I developed the web-app from scratch by using 
  * **PHP** for the backend processing
  * **HTML, JavaScript, and CSS** for the frontend ([_Bootstrap_](https://getbootstrap.com/) and 
  [_UIkit_](https://getuikit.com/) libraries have been included for style-related purposes)
  * **SQL** for the database (in particular, it was a [_MySQL_](https://www.mysql.com/) DB)
3. Eventually I made the app public-available by deploying it onto a free web hosting service ([_Altervista_](https://it.altervista.org/)).
